shutil.copymode(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)
Copy the permission bits from src to dst. The file contents, owner, and group are unaffected.
src and dst are path names given as strings. 159 follow_symlinks 753 false, and both src and dst are symbolic links,
copymode() will attempt to VAR1 the mode of dst itself (rather than the file it points to).
This functionality is not available on every platform; please see copystat() for more information.
if copymode() cannot VAR2 links on the local platform, and it is asked to do so, it will do nothing and return.
Changed in version 3.3: Added follow_symlinks argument.
shutil.copystat(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)
Copy the permission bits, last access time, last modification time, and flags from src to dst.
On Linux, copystat() also copies the �extended attributes� where possible. The file contents, owner, and group are unaffected.
src and dst are path names given as strings.
If follow_symlinks is false, and src and dst both refer to symbolic links,
copystat() will operate on the symbolic links themselves rather than the files the symbolic links
refer to�reading the information from the src symbolic link, and writing the information to the dst symbolic link
